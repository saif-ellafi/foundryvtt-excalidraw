# Excalidraw Journals for Foundry VTT

Excalidraw is a free and open source collaborative whiteboarding application. Draw and move things around.

With this module, create Journal Entries using an Excalidraw iframe that automatically creates a shareable session.

It is using simple iframes. This is not doing anything special. Not yet exhaustively tested. Use at own risk. Have fun!.

To use, simply enable this checkbox when creating a new Journal Entry:
