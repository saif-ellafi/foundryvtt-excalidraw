# Excalidraw Journals for Foundry VTT

Excalidraw is a free and open source collaborative virtual whiteboard for sketching and diagrams. With this, you can brainstorm together very easily with your players.

With this module, create Journal Entries using an Excalidraw iframe that automatically creates a shareable session.

**This module is embedding Excalidraws Online version!**

_Maybe in the future I can work out a native implementation that stays within your world. Help is welcome!_

## Caveats (Can be fixed eventually)

* This is embedding the online version of excalidraw (i.e. requires internet connection)
* Dark/Light mode not remembered
* Excalidraw Data not stored in your world, but rather online

### Appreciations

Asacolips, Javiondox and ronix for cool ideas and testing help.

### Future Ideas

Make Character Sheet adapters, so we can create character sheets with this system.
