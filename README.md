# Excalidraw Journals for Foundry VTT

Excalidraw is a free and open source collaborative virtual whiteboard for sketching and diagrams. With this, you can brainstorm together very easily with your players.

With this module, create Journal Entries using an Excalidraw iframe that automatically creates a shareable session.

It is using simple iframes. This is not doing anything special. Not yet exhaustively tested. Use at own risk. Have fun!.

To use, simply enable this checkbox when creating a new Journal Entry:
